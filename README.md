# Drug Classification Using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning techniques to classify drugs based on patient features like Age, Sex, Blood Pressure (BP), Cholesterol levels, and Na-to-K ratio. The objective is to predict the appropriate drug class for each patient.

## Project Overview
This project implements various machine learning models, including:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

The dataset contains patient information such as age, sex, blood pressure levels, cholesterol levels, and the Na-to-K ratio. Based on these features, the goal is to predict the appropriate drug from a set of possible drug classes.

## Data
The dataset contains 200 records, each representing a patient. The features include:
- **Age**: Integer value representing the age of the patient.
- **Sex**: Categorical value (`Male` or `Female`).
- **Blood Pressure**: Categorical value (`High`, `Normal`, `Low`).
- **Cholesterol**: Categorical value (`High`, `Normal`).
- **Na-to-K Ratio**: A floating-point number representing the ratio of sodium to potassium in the blood.
- **Drug**: The target variable indicating the prescribed drug.

## Preprocessing
- **Encoding**: Categorical features (Sex, BP, Cholesterol) are encoded into numerical form.
- **Train-Test Split**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets to validate model performance.
- **Data Visualization**: Histograms and pie charts are used to explore feature distributions.

## Models Used
The following models are implemented:
1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
   - Accuracy: 73.3%
   - Distance-based classification, sensitive to the choice of `k`.
   
2. **Decision Tree Classifier**
   - Accuracy comparable to KNN.
   - Works by recursively splitting the data based on feature thresholds.
   
3. **Random Forest Classifier**
   - Ensemble learning technique combining multiple decision trees.
   - Improved accuracy and generalization compared to individual models.

## Results
- **Random Forest Classifier** provided the best overall accuracy and stability across the test dataset.
- The model successfully classified drugs with higher accuracy and reduced overfitting compared to KNN and Decision Trees.

To run the project, the following Python libraries are required:
- `pandas`
